    <p style="font-size: large;">
      Hi, I'm Alfin.<br>
      I'm a graduate student pursuing my master's in Computer Science. <br>
      This portfolio showcases my take on assignments from a Udemy course that I'm taking this summer.<br> <br>
      The rules for this endeavor include:
      <ol style="font-size: large;">
        <li>I can only use what I have learned so far for each project.</li>
        <li>I have to devise ways to use everything I know for each new project.</li>
        <li>I can use concepts from external readings that I happen upon during my study if I deem them necessary in the project context.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">
      Check back in from time to time to see my progress. I'm very excited about this new journey.
    </p>
